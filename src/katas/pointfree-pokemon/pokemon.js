 // 1. fix the spec "Pokemon-Kata should find the nearest distance to a Pokemon of type 'Normal'"
 // 2. write the body of the pending spec "Pokemon-Kata should find the name of the nearest Pokemon of type 'Normal'" and provide a working implementation

// You can use the prepared functions "x", "y", "square" and "distance".

// Challenges/Constraints
// ----------------------
// * Be 100% strict about using pointfree style: no function-keywords or =>-Operators at all.
// * Use transducers for lazy evaluation.
